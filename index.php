                <p>
                    Kolhapur is a historic city of Maharashtra. It is the district headquarters of Kolhapur district. Prior to Indian Independence, Kolhapur was a nineteen gun salute princely state ruled by the Bhosale Chhatrapati (Bhosale royal clan) of the Maratha Empire.
                    Kolhapur is mentioned in the Devi Gita, the final and key chapter of the Devi-Bhagavata Purana, a special text of Shaktism. Kolhapur is noted as a place of Kollamma worship. In the text, Devi says,

                    "O King of Mountains! Still I am now telling something out of My affection to My Bhaktas. Hear. There is a great place of pilgrimage named Kollapura in the southern country. Here the Devi Ambabai always dwells."
                    The famous Jyotiba temple is also located in the Kolhapur.
                    Kolhapur is famous in west Maharashtra for religious accounts.
                    The state of Kolhapur was established by Tarabai in 1707 because of the succession dispute over the Maratha kingship. The Maratha throne was then governed by descendants of Tarabai. One of the prominent Kings was Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj (Shahu of Kolhapur). In his reign he promoted cost free education to people of all castes and fought against untouchability. The state was annexed by the British in the 19th century. After India's independence in 1947, the Maharaja of Kolhapur acceded to the Dominion of India on 14 August 1947 and merged with Bombay State on 1 March 1949. Kolhapur is sometimes found spelled as Colapore.[8] Often, Kolhapur is also referred as Dakshin Kashi (Dakshin in Hindi means South, Kashi is a holy city in Northern India) due to its rich religious history.
